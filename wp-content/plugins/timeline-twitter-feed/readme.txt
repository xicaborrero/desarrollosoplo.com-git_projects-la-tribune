Output timeline feeds and multiple hashtags into your WordPress site as flat HTML.

== Description ==

Timeline Twitter Feed let's you output your timeline feed and multiple hashtags into your WordPress site as flat HTML.
The output is customizable on nearly every aspect. With or without profile pictures, tweet date, usernames before tweets, hashtags and usernames as links etc. etc.
CSS styling can be added/overwrited via your theme's stylesheet or in the Timeline Twitter Feed settings screen.
There is also a widget to easily add a Twitter feed to your header, sidebar or footer, if your theme supports it.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why is the feed not showing tweets when `hashtags only` option is selected? =

If you show tweets from hashtags, unwanted tweets will be filtered out.
Unwanted teets are tweets that contain words from the `discard tweets` option, tweets that are retweets or tweets with hashtags from your own account.
Try to set the `number of tweets to get in advance` to a higher number.
