This plugin utilizes Google reCAPTCHA to help your blog stay clear of spams. You can use this plugin with Akismet and Contact Form 7.

== Description ==

In the 21th century, spamming could be one of the most annoying problems for a website. Especially if you use some publishing platforms like WordPress, your blog WILL be spammed and no default methods will save you from such nightmare. This plugin utilizes the popular anti-spam library, Google reCAPTCHA, to help your blog stay clear of spams.

Akismet and Contact Form 7 are supported out of the box.

= 1.1.2 =
* Fixed an issue where captcha is not displayed but still checked when added to a Contact Form 7 form.

= 1.1.1 =
* You can now choose to add captcha below comment text area without using a theme function. More info [here](http://betterwp.net/wordpress-plugins/bwp-recaptcha/#usage)

* Added support for other plugins that include a slightly different version of reCAPTCHA library to avoid conflicts
* Added Italian reCAPTCHA language (`it`)

* Improved user registration and site registration form on a multi-site installation
* Fixed an issue where a hidden iframe is adding margin to bottom of page in Google Chrome and Safari. This is merely a workaround solution so hopefully Google will fix this issue in reCAPTCHA
