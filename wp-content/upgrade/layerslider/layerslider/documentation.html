					<section>

<li>Navigate to <code>Plugins</code> -> <code>Add new</code> page on your WordPress admin area.</li>
<li>Select the <code>Upload</code> button on the top and choose the <strong>"layersliderwp-x.x.x.installable.zip"</strong> file that you've extracted from the downloaded archive, then hit the <code>Install Now</code> button.</li>
<li>WordPress may ask you to enter your FTP login credentials. Click on <code>Proceed</code> when you finished.</li>
<li>The plugin is now installed, click on the <code>Activate Plugin</code> button.</li>
							</ol>

							<h4>Installation via FTP</h4>
							<ol class="nomargin">

<li>Find the <strong>"layersliderwp-x.x.x.installable.zip"</strong> file in the extracted contents and unpack that archive as well.</li>

<li>Navigate to the <code>Plugins</code> page on your WordPress admin area and click the <code>Activate</code> button below LayerSlider WP.</li>
							</ol>
					</section>

					<!-- Plugin updates -->
					<section>
							<h4>Auto-update</h4>
							<p>
								Since LayerSlider WP 4.0.0 we are supporting automatic updates. The auto-update feature requires a valid item purchase code; you can find it by navigating to your CodeCanyon downloads page and downloading your License Certificate for the corresponding item. Your Item Purchase code is in the downloaded text file. Please enter this code at the LayerSlider WP main plugin page in the "Auto-updates" box.
							</p>
							<h4>Manual update</h4>
							<p>
								Once you've downloaded the most recent version from your CodeCanyon downloads page you can deactivate and remove the old version, then install the new one. Your sliders and settings are in the database, removing the plugin won't touch them. The new version always has backwards compatibility, so you don't have to worry about anything.
							</p>
							<h4>Changes during updates</h4>
							<p>
								Depending on the default settings, you may have to enable or disable some settings related with the new features. If you experience any unwanted behavior change after an update, it is always a good idea to check the settings of your sliders, there are probably new options to control these changes.
							</p>
					</section>

					<!-- Language support -->
					<section>
							<h4>How can I create multilingual sliders?</h4>
							<p>Please read the integrated docs in the plugin by opening a Help menu on the top right corner of your admin area. It includes the necessary instructions about using WPML, qTranslate and other popular localization/translation solutions.</p>
							<p>You can also read our <a href="http://support.kreaturamedia.com/faq/4/layerslider-for-wordpress/#group-7" target="_blank">online version</a> in our FAQs.</p>
							<h4>How to translate the admin user interface?</h4>
							<ol>
								<li>
									<strong>Download PoEdit</strong>
									<p>There are several apps available to help you with translating .PO files. PoEdit is a popular one, and it's available on every major platform. You can download it from <a href="http://www.poedit.net/download.php" target="_blank">here</a>. </p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<strong>Start translating</strong>
									<p>Open the default LayerSlider-en_US.po file from your "/wp-content/plugins/LayerSlider/locales/" folder. When you save your work PoEdit will generate you a .MO file which will be needed to apply your work.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<strong>Name your files properly</strong>
									<p>WordPress recognizes your localization by a special formatting of file names. You will need to include the right <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_chapter/gettext_16.html#Language-Codes" target="_blank">language</a> and <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_chapter/gettext_16.html#Country-Codes" target="_blank">country</a> codes so it can identify what language is your work made for.</p>
									<p>For example, a French localization would have the file names: LayerSlider-fr_FR.po and LayerSlider-fr_FR.mo. You must follow this syntax, including the dash, underscore, and lower- or uppercase letters.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<strong>Apply your localization</strong>
									<p>Copy your newly created .PO and .MO files into the "/wp-content/plugins/LayerSlider/locales/" folder. WordPress should use them immediately if you named your files properly.</p>
								</li>
							</ol>
					</section>

					<!-- Backwards compatibility -->
					<section>
						<h4>A note on backwards compatibility</h4>
						<p>We always take care to support sliders built with earlier versions of the plugin, thus you shouldn't have to worry about updates. However, in major releases we are usually making big changes under the hood, and it is possible that you might need to adjust some additional settings.</p>

						<h4>Old slide transitions are deprecated</h4>
						<p>We've removed the old slide transition settings from the admin interface. Your previously created sliders will continue to work the same as before, but you won't be able to edit them without choosing from the new slide transitions. Remember, we have some very similar transitions, and you can always modify or build a custom one with the Transition Builder.</p>
						<div class="km-notification info cf">
							<span class="icon-info-circled"></span>
							We might completely stop supporting the old slide transition system in the distant future.
						</div>

						<h4>Old layer transitions are deprecated</h4>
						<p>In version 5.0.0 we have new layer transition options that offers more complex and flexible animations. Your earlier sliders will continue to work the same as before without making any changes. The admin interface, however, drops the old options in favor of the new system, and your settings will be converted. Since these new options are working in a different way, your sliders might be slightly different in some rare cases, but it should be super close.</p>
						<div class="km-notification info cf">
							<span class="icon-info-circled"></span>
							We might completely stop supporting the old layer transition system in the distant future.
